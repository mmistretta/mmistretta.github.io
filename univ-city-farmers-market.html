					<p>Last Saturday we decided to checkout the University City Farmer's Market.  The market is located at the Shoppes at University Place right by the Famous Toastery in University City. It happens on Saturdays, May through October. Here you can have breakfast and shop around for all your produce needs for the week.</p>
					<p>We started off our farmer's market visit with some coffee from the Drip Joint and a pastry from Manolo's.  A perfect Saturday morning breakfast.</p>
					<p>From there we explored the stands.  We were immediately drawn to the produce at the Farm at Dover Vineyards stand.  Their berries looks amazing as did the mushrooms! </p>

					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/farmers-market/mushrooms.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;"/></span>
					<p>We continued to explore the stands and were very impressed by the variety of unique mushroom varieties provided by Growing for Good.  The vendor provides locally grown mushrooms as well as cool recipes for how to use them.  One of the unique mushrooms and recipes was a crab cake made with a Lion's Mane mushroom. </p>

					<p>Next, we continued to look at produce.  The stand from Pine Knot Farms was the largest one. They have organic sweet potatos, rhubarb, fennel, and several types of watermelon.  They also had meat available for purchase.  The produce looked some of the freshest I have seen for the value.</p>

					<span class="image featured"><img src="/images/farmers-market/watermelon.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;"/></span>
					<p>Outside of the produce, the market also has fresh flowers both in the form of bouquets as well as single stems.  In you get hungry or thirsty there is a local jerky vendor as well as a lemonade/juice vendor called Squeeze.</p>

					<p>One of the things that sets the university city farmer's market apart is their cooking demos. The demos are put on by Ms. Princess. She also sells her cookbook and homemade jams. You can also find the jams in the grocery store.  Cooking demos happen at 10:30, 11:30, and 12:30.  Be sure to plan your visit accordingly.</p>

					<p>While you enjoy the cooking demos, the kids have activities of their own.  The market had face painting as well as children's storytime with the reading fairies. </p>

					<p>In addition to the food offerings, the market also has quite a few retail type vendors.  Multiple sell jewelry.  There is also a CBD vendor and some offer clothing.</p>
